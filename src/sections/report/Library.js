            <b>Feedback</b>: When users successfully login in and data is
            loading from the server, a loading animation appears in the center
            of the screen. It provides better user experience to users by
            telling people that the request from them is received and being
            processed.

            <b>Visibility</b>: Title of the library page moves to top of the
            display window when users scroll down and view more albums. Since
            users are focusing on searching for an album instead of the title of
            the library, the title should take less screen to avoid attracting
            attention from users.

          <TextContent>
            <b>Representation</b>: Two types of representation are provided for
            different usersâ€™ needs. View mode album list is album title focused,
            and view album grid mode is album cover focused. Users are able to
            select different modes by their preference.

          <TextContent>
            <b>Chunking</b>: Album cover, album title and album artist is
            collected into a grid. This keeps the related things close together
            and aligned.
